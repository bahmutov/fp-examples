## Goal

Given an array of numbers and a constant, multiply each number by the constant
and print the result

```js
// given:
var numbers = [3, 1, 7];
var constant = 2;
// expected output printed
//  6
//  2
//  14
```

We start with imperative code

```js
var numbers = [3, 1, 7]
var constant = 2
for (var k = 0; k < numbers.length; k += 1) {
  console.log(numbers[k] * constant)
}
// 6
// 2
// 14
```

Great, but this code is "hairy" - it has sticking parts, variables that are exposed, and can
interact with the outside code. For example, variable `k` that is *only* used to iterate the
array can now be used by other code.

```js
var numbers = [3, 1, 7]
var constant = 2
for (var k = 0; k < numbers.length; k += 1) {
  console.log(numbers[k] * constant)
}
console.log('k =', k)
// 6
// 2
// 14
// k = 3
```

Luckily, ES6 can solve variable problem inside the `for ...` loop

```js
var numbers = [3, 1, 7]
var constant = 2
for (let k = 0; k < numbers.length; k += 1) {
  console.log(numbers[k] * constant)
}
console.log('k =', k)
// 6
// 2
// 14
// index.js:14
// console.log('k =', k)
//                    ^
// ReferenceError: k is not defined
```

We also want our code to *describe* what it does; we want to understand what is going
to happen by reading the *static source code*. In this example, the constant `constant`
should *be really a constant*.

```js
var numbers = [3, 1, 7]
var constant = 2
for (let k = 0; k < numbers.length; k += 1) {
  console.log(numbers[k] * constant)
  constant = 10
}
// 6
// 10
// 70
```

Again, ES6 to the rescue.

```js
var numbers = [3, 1, 7]
const constant = 2
for (let k = 0; k < numbers.length; k += 1) {
  console.log(numbers[k] * constant)
  constant = 10
}
// 6
// index.js:13
//  constant = 10
//           ^
// TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

We can even catch this assignment without running the code by using a linter
like [eslint](http://eslint.org/) and [standard](https://standardjs.com/) (which is really
built on top of `eslint`)

```
standard --verbose --fix 'src/**/*.js'

standard: Use JavaScript Standard Style (https://standardjs.com)
  index.js:13:3: 'constant' is constant. (no-const-assign)
```

Great, and since we want to express that we are NOT modifying the input array, let us
declare the array constant.

```js
const numbers = [3, 1, 7]
const constant = 2
for (let k = 0; k < numbers.length; k += 1) {
  console.log(numbers[k] * constant)
}
```

But of course JavaScript lies about it. 

```js
const numbers = [3, 1, 7]
const constant = 2
numbers[0] = 100
for (let k = 0; k < numbers.length; k += 1) {
  console.log(numbers[k] * constant)
}
// 200
// 2
// 14
```

In JavaScript `const X = Y` means only the `X` is constant, not the inner values of `Y`
if `Y` is an object or an array. And this leads to lots of troubles, because passing arrays
and objects to other functions means they can be modified *even when you hope they stay
constant*.

Using 3rd party library like [seamless-immutable](https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable)
we can silently prevent modifications to our data

```js
const immutable = require('seamless-immutable')
const numbers = immutable([3, 1, 7])
const constant = 2
numbers[0] = 100
for (let k = 0; k < numbers.length; k += 1) {
  console.log(numbers[k] * constant)
}
// 6
// 2
// 14
```

Even better, by running in strict mode we can throw an exception when trying to modify
immutable object.

```js
'use strict'
const immutable = require('seamless-immutable')
const numbers = immutable([3, 1, 7])
const constant = 2
numbers[0] = 100
// index.js:4
// numbers[0] = 100
//            ^
// TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property '0' of object '[object Array]'
```

## Testing

How can we test this code? We cannot get into the `for` loop, and the only way to test it is
to intercept the *side effects* - the printing to the console object. We can write a unit
test to spy on `console.log` using [sinon](http://sinonjs.org/) with 
cmo[mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test runner

```js
/* eslint-env mocha */
it('prints numbers', () => {
  const sinon = require('sinon')
  sinon.spy(console, 'log')
  require('./index.js')
  console.assert(console.log.calledWith(6), 'printed 6')
  console.assert(console.log.calledWith(2), 'printed 2')
  console.assert(console.log.calledWith(14), 'printed 14')
})
```

Everything is beautiful when we run this test

```
mocha src/**/*spec.js

6
2
14
  âœ“ prints numbers (154ms)

  1 passing (163ms)
```
